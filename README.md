This system I wrote long time ago is designed for managing staffs easily. This system is written by Python,whose graphical interface is completed by PyQt. The database I used is Mysql. In this system, I used the views ,stored procedures and triggers of Mysql. Among  these techniques, what I used most is triggers used to complete the data 
interactions between data tables.
This system is divided into two parts,the management end and the  staff end. The management end can manage the data information. The staff end only has the privilege of read. By the way, when you want to enter either  the management end or the staff end, the account and the password are required, otherwise the login box will shake like this.

The partial operations are shown below.

The aim why I share this system online is to help the people who want to use python to write their own graphical program.
